# Basic Weather Application

## Introduction
A basic flutter based Weather Application which displays real time weather data fetched from weatherapi.com 

## Functionality and UI
The homepage (left) is the default front that displays when you first open the app. It shows the weather of the home city you set. You can edit your name and home city by clicking on the profile icon in the bottom navigation bar.

- Improved UI upcoming
- Autocorrect and autocomplete for the cities, so you don't have to worry about the spellings!
